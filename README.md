# Medialib

Medialib is a group of definitions and conventions for media, media addons and media addon management.

**[This project uses the Addonlib project](https://github.com/addonlib-project)**

By using Medialib in your media and media source libraries, you make them compatible with all other medias and medias of the same type using the same library, simplifying their use by other developers and the end users.

Projects using Medialib:

- [medialib-manga](https://github.com/medialib-project/medialib-manga)
- [medialib-manga-source-mangadex](https://github.com/medialib-project/medialib-manga-source-mangadex)

## Use cases

Defining ISO types for certain medias (for example mangas with the [medialib-manga](https://github.com/medialib-project/medialib-manga) project)

Defining ISO sources for those medias (for example fetching mangas with the [medialib-manga-source-mangadex](https://github.com/medialib-project/medialib-manga-source-mangadex))

Them being ISO means that future manga and manga sources libraries **can be used together** with se same codebase!
